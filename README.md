# LoginExample

## How to run the app?

#### Option 1:

2) Use the following credentials to do login:
    - Email: `test@email.com`
    - Password: `test123`

#### Option 2:

1) Replace `google-services.json` in the app module with your own

## What the app does?

It uses Firebase Auth to authenticate a user using email and password.\
After the user is authenticated the biometric prompt will be shown.\
If the user uses biometric to authenticate, UID received from Firebase will be encrypted and stored.\
When the app is opened the next time, the biometric prompt is shown immediately.\
If the user decides to use it, email and password input will be skipped, and the user will be redirected to the Home screen.
